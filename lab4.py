"""
Write a program that does the following:

1.  Creates a variable that stores the current year
2.  Prompts the user to enter their name
3.  Prompts the user to enter their birth year
4.  Calculates the age of the user using the current year and birth year
5.  Prints a message to the user (in one line) saying "Hello <name>, you are <age> years old today." 
    where <name> and <age> are the values from steps 2 and 4
6.  Prints 'Goodbye!' on a separate line

with the addition of conditional statements to ensure that:

a) the user is notified if an invalid value (for birth year) is entered
b) the message from step 5 is only output if a numeric value is entered
c) the program does not crash if the user enters an empty string (by hitting the enter key without typing any text) for name or birth year
